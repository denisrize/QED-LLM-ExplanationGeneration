## Training and Evaluation Pipeline

### Training Pipeline

1. **Configuration Loading:**  
   The script loads model, data, and training configurations using `get_few_shot_config()` from `config_models.py`, which automatically sets optimal hyperparameters based on the model type and training regime.

2. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Loads training data from `qed_data/` directory
   - Applies prompt formatting based on `--prompt_examples` setting using templates from `config_prompt.py`
   - Filters data to the specified number of examples if `--max_examples` is provided

3. **Model Fine-Tuning:**  
   - Uses LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient fine-tuning with 4-bit quantization
   - Supports various instruction-tuned models with model-specific configurations
   - Saves checkpoints and final model under `models_fine_tuned/[model_name]_fewshot_[prompt_type]/`

4. **Logging:**  
   - All training progress is logged to `qed_fewshot_experiment.log`
   - TensorBoard logs are generated for monitoring training metrics

### Evaluation Pipeline

1. **Model Loading:**  
   - If `--eval_only` is set, loads the specified pre-trained model from `--model_path`
   - Uses `setup_finetuned_model_for_evaluation()` for loading fine-tuned models

2. **Prediction Generation:**  
   - Loads validation data (typically `qed-dev.jsonlines`)
   - Generates predictions using `model_generation_on_qed()` with specified generation parameters
   - Saves detailed predictions to `qed_model_results/[model_path]/[prompt_config]/detailed_predictions.jsonlines`

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:**  
   - Runs `batch_evaluate_with_different_overlaps()` to compute metrics across multiple overlap thresholds
   - Generates evaluation results for overlap ratios: [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]
   - Produces both "valid_only" and "normalized" evaluation modes

## Model Output Extraction and Span Handling

### JSON Extraction Process

1. **Response Parsing:**  
   - The model is prompted to output structured JSON containing answers, selected sentences, and referential equalities
   - The system first attempts to extract JSON from markdown code blocks (```json...```)
   - If not found, uses regex to locate JSON objects within free-form text

2. **Fallback Strategies:**  
   - If JSON is malformed, attempts partial parsing to recover usable information
   - Handles common JSON formatting errors (missing braces, trailing commas, etc.)
   - Logs problematic responses for manual inspection in `problematic_predictions.jsonlines`

### Span Offset Calculation

1. **Answer Span Extraction:**  
   - For each predicted answer, finds exact character offsets (start, end) in the source context
   - Uses fuzzy string matching when exact matches are not found
   - Handles multiple answer spans when the model predicts multiple answers

2. **Selected Sentence Mapping:**  
   - Maps model-selected sentences back to original paragraph offsets
   - Supports both sentence ID-based selection and full-text matching
   - Validates sentence boundaries and handles sentence segmentation edge cases

3. **Entity Span Alignment:**  
   - Extracts question entities and their corresponding context entities from referential equalities
   - Computes precise character offsets for all referential equality pairs
   - Handles multi-word entities and nested entity recognition

---

## Evaluation Methodology

### Understanding QED Task Structure

A **QED example** consists of:
- **Question**: A natural language question
- **Context**: A paragraph containing the answer
- **Answer**: Spans in the context that answer the question
- **Selected Sentence**: The sentence that entails the answer
- **Referential Equalities**: Mappings between question entities and context entities

### Strict vs. Non-Strict Matching

1. **Strict Evaluation (`strict=True`):**  
   - Predicted spans must **exactly match** ground truth spans (character-perfect alignment)
   - No tolerance for boundary differences or partial matches
   - Most conservative evaluation setting

2. **Non-Strict Evaluation (`strict=False`):**  
   - Uses **overlap-based matching** with configurable F1 thresholds
   - Entities are considered equivalent if they satisfy:
     - Normalized text matching (after lowercasing, removing punctuation/articles)
     - Sufficient span overlap based on F1 score

### Overlap Ratio Calculation

The overlap ratio is computed using **F1 score between predicted and ground truth spans**:

```
F1 = tp / (tp + (fp + fn) / 2)

Where:
- tp (true positive): Character overlap between spans
- fp (false positive): Characters in prediction but not in ground truth  
- fn (false negative): Characters in ground truth but not in prediction
```

**Example:**
```
Ground truth: [10, 25] "machine learning"
Prediction:   [12, 23] "chine learnin"
F1 = 11 / (11 + (2 + 4) / 2) = 11 / 14 ≈ 0.79
```

### Evaluation Thresholds

The system evaluates at multiple overlap thresholds:
- **0.5**: Requires ≥50% F1 overlap (lenient)
- **0.6**: Requires ≥60% F1 overlap
- **0.7**: Requires ≥70% F1 overlap  
- **0.8**: Requires ≥80% F1 overlap
- **0.9**: Requires ≥90% F1 overlap (strict)

**[📊 PLOT 7: Detailed Evaluation Across Thresholds]**
*Suggested: Heatmap showing performance matrix (models × metrics × thresholds)*

### Performance Analysis Results

Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that fine-tuned models consistently outperform base models across all overlap thresholds, with particularly strong improvements in entity relationship tasks:

| Metric | Threshold | Base Performance | Fine-tuned Performance | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| All Mention F1 | 0.5 | 25.6% | **36.3%** | **+41.8%** |
| All Mention F1 | 0.7 | 23.1% | **33.1%** | **+43.3%** |
| All Mention F1 | 0.9 | 19.8% | **28.3%** | **+43.0%** |
| Pair Alignment F1 | 0.5 | 17.0% | **22.6%** | **+32.9%** |
| Answer Accuracy | 0.5 | 51.9% | **59.4%** | **+14.4%** |

**[📊 PLOT 8: Error Analysis Comparison]**
*Suggested: Stacked bar chart showing types of errors (JSON parsing, span extraction, entity alignment) before vs after fine-tuning*

### Evaluation Modes

1. **Valid-Only Metrics:**  
   - Computed only on examples where the model produced valid JSON output
   - Excludes examples with parsing failures or malformed responses

2. **Normalized Metrics:**  
   - Treats invalid/missing predictions as False
   - Provides a complete evaluation across all ground truth examples
   - More conservative and comprehensive measure

---

## Data Processing

### Ground Truth Filtering

1. **Missing Annotation Removal:**  
   - Ground truth examples lacking required annotation fields are automatically filtered out
   - Ensures fair evaluation by excluding malformed ground truth data

2. **Validation:**  
   - Validates that all ground truth examples have required fields: `annotation`, `question_text`, `paragraph_text`
   - Ensures entity spans and answer spans are properly formatted and within document boundaries

### Model Response Processing

1. **JSON Validation:**  
   - Attempts to parse model responses as JSON
   - Handles various JSON formatting issues automatically
   - Logs problematic responses for analysis

2. **Span Extraction:**  
   - Extracts answer spans, selected sentences, and referential equalities
   - Computes character offsets for all predicted spans
   - Handles edge cases like empty bridges, multiple spans, and missing context
